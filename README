			     DrIFT

This package contains a source distribution of DrIFT, a tool for automatic
derivation of Haskell class instances. DrIFT was formerly known as Derive.

the current homepage is at
    http://repetae.net/john/computer/haskell/DrIFT/


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contents of this package:

  - src         Directory with the source files of the DrIFT tool
  - example     Directory with examples of using the DrIFT tool
  - docs        Documentation

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To configure and install DrIFT, type the following:

  ./configure --prefix=<dir>
  make install

Where <dir> is the directory in which you want to install the tool. Note that
a haskell compiler (nhc98 or ghc) must be in your path. Otherwise, supply the
location of a Haskell compiler as follows:

  ./configure --prefix=<dir> --with-hc=<haskell compiler>
  make install


If you have pulled the source from the darcs repository, you must first build
the autotools scripts by running

 automake -a
 autoreconf


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use DrIFT, heed the following instructions (which were taken from the
DrIFT v1.0 distribution).

  Installation
  ------------
  copy the 'DrIFT' executable to somewhere on your path

  set DERIVEPATH to the list of directories you wish to search for
  modules / interfaces.

  DERIVEPATH is quite fussy about the format the list should take :-
    * each path should be separated by ':'
    * no space inserted anywhere
    * no final '/' on the end of a path

  bad  - /users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/:/users/grad/nww/share/hugs/lib/hugs/
